# Directory Hierarchy Generator

This Python script provides a convenient way to generate a hierarchical text representation of a directory structure. It helps you visualize the organization of nested folders and files, making it easier to navigate and understand complex file systems.

## Features:

- Efficiently traverses directories and subdirectories.
- Generates a clear and human-readable hierarchical text output.
- Supports various operating systems.
- Offers flexibility for potential customization of the output format (future enhancements).

## Usage:

1. **Save the script**: Save the provided Python script as `directory.py`.

2. **Install dependencies**: As of now, the script relies on the built-in `os` module and doesn't require additional dependencies.

3. **Run the script**: Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing `directory.py`, and execute:

```bash
python directory.py
Use code with caution.
```

4. **Provide input directory path**: Replace `"your_directory_path"` within the script with the actual path to the directory you want to analyze.

5. **Output**: The script will generate the hierarchy text and display the path to the created file named `hierarchy.txt` within the same directory.

### Example:

```
|- Folder1
|   |- File1.txt
|   |- Subfolder1
|       |- File2.docx
|   |- AnotherFile.png
|- Folder2
    |- File3.csv
```
